# Database-Project
It is a simple software developed by me in my 5th semester of my course using MySQL and java swing. This is just a personal project and designed for my own satisfaction.
The application is developed the help of Apache NetBeans. it contains various java files to read ,update, delete the data from mySQL database. 
The project requires the knowledge of Java swing, Java frames , MySQL database etc.
